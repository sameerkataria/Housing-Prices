# Housing-Prices

## INTRODUCTION
➢ We have used the famous Ames housing dataset and used Multiple Linear Regression and other machine learning models to predict the sale price of houses based on various features.<br />
➢ The dataset is available on Kaggle which includes 81 features describing a wide range if characteristics of 1460 homes in Ames, Iowa that are sold between 2006 and 2010.<br />
➢ The dataset consists of information about 1460 houses<br />

## Objective:
➢ Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the intricacies of dataset.<br />
➢ Perform feature selection to understand the variables affecting the housing prices.<br />
➢ Understanding categorical variables as sparse matrix can reduce the adjusted R2 in a misleading way.<br />
➢ Check for all regression assumptions.<br />
➢ Hypothesis Testing to corroborate all the results.<br />
➢ Compare results with other advanced Machine Learning models.<br />
